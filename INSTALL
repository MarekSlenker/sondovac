Sondovač 1.3 Install instructions

Sondovač is a script to create orthologous low-copy nuclear probes from 
transcriptome and genome skim data for target enrichment.


Requirements to run Sondovač
================================================================================

Sondovač is currently tested on major Linux distributions (in current versions) 
openSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, Centos and Scientific Linux; and 
on Mac OS X.

In order to run Sondovač you need a UNIX-based operating system (preferably 
Linux, alternatively Mac OS X) equipped with BASH or compatible shell 
interpreter (this should by default be available for any Linux distribution, 
Mac OS X and any other UNIX-based operating system like Solaris, BSD and its 
variants etc). You should use the current operating system version supported by 
upstream, otherwise we will not be able to help you in case of problems. Older 
operating systems can have different versions of shell and system libraries, 
which can cause various problems and incompatibilities.

Sondovač uses several scientific software packages (namely BLAT, Bowtie2, 
CD-HIT, FLASH, Geneious, htsjdk, libgtextutils, and SAMtools - see required 
versions and links below), and basic UNIX tools. Sondovač will check if those 
programs are installed - available in the PATH (i.e. if the shell application 
can locate and launch respective binaries). If you have those packages 
installed (in current versions), ensure their binaries are in PATH. This should 
not be a problem for basic tools available in any UNIX-based operating system, 
as basic installation usually contains all needed tools. If you lack some of 
the required tools, the script will notify you, and you will have to install 
them manually. If this is needed, check the documentation for your operating 
system.

If required programs are not installed, Sondovač will offer you installation. 
You can use precompiled binaries available together with the script (this is 
the recommended option) or (sometimes) from the web.In case you wish to compile 
the required software yourself, the script will guide you through this process. 
This is recommended only for advanced users, as compilation might sometimes be 
very tricky. Users of Mac OS X can install those applications also using 
Homebrew (see https://brew.sh/). For compilation you need Apache Ant, GNU G++, 
GNU GCC, GIT, Java/OpenJDK, libpng developmental files, and zlib developmental 
files. Ensure that you have those tools available - they should be readily 
available for any UNIX-based operating system.

sondovac_part_a.sh requires (and will install) the following software packages:
* BLAT
* Bowtie2
* SAMtools
* FLASH

sondovac_part_b.sh requires (and will install) the following software packages:
* CD-HIT
* BLAT

Geneious is required for step 7 of the pipeline. See below, README and PDF 
manual for details.

The following UNIX tools are required to run Sondovač. They are usually readily 
available in UNIX systems (but see note for Mac OS X below), so there is 
usually no need to install them manually. The tools are awk, bc, bunzip2, cat, 
cp, curl or wget, cut, dirname, echo, egrep, cd, g++, gcc, grep, gunzip, join, 
less, lsb_release or python, make, mkdir, perl, pwd, sed, sort, tar, tr, uname, 
uniq, unzip, wc.

For Mac OS X users, Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) will be installed by the 
script, and it will install (new software or newer versions) Apache Ant, BASH 
(the shell interpreter), GNU AWK, GNU coreutils, GNU GCC, GNU grep, GNU make, 
GNU sed, and wget. Mac OS X is missing some tools and for others (typically 
sed, grep or awk) contains outdated BSD versions. The script will guide the 
user through the process, and it is possible to safely and easily remove these 
tools afterwards if the user wishes to do so.

See the PDF manual for details about tools required by Sondovač and their 
manual installation. For most users it should be sufficient to be guided 
by the script to install needed tools automatically.

When Sondovač starts, a directory "bin" is created in the current working 
directory. Sondovač saves binaries of required software packages in this 
directory (if they are not available). The user can then add this directory 
to PATH, move or delete it afterwards. See the PDF manual for details.


First launch of Sondovač
================================================================================

Download the latest version of Sondovač from 

https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/releases/

and unpack the archive. You can run Sondovač from any directory. In command 
line navigate to the directory with the unpacked Sondovač files:

  cd /path/to/directory_with_sondovac

and start it by

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -h

to see basic usage instructions. See README and PDF manual for more information.

Examples (see README and PDF manual for explanation of command line parameters)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic and most simple usage (running in interactive mode, see README and 
PDF manual):

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -i


Help for usage of terminal
================================================================================

If you are not familiar with the usage of command line, familiarise yourself 
with some basic tutorials first. You can try some of these:

Geneious
================================================================================

Sondovač workflow is divided into three parts (see README and PDF manual for 
details):
1) Raw input data are analyzed by sondovac_part_a.sh.
2) Sequences obtained in part A are assembled by Geneious in a separate step by 
     the user.
3) Final probes are produced by sondovac_part_b.sh.

For part (2) of the script the user must have Geneious. We plan to replace it 
with a free open-source command line tool in a future release of Sondovač. 
Visit https://www.geneious.com/ for download, purchase, installation and usage 
of Geneious.
