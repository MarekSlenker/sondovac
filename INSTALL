Requirements to run Sondovač

Sondovač is currently tested on Linux distributions Ubuntu and openSUSE. 
Testing on Mac OS X and another major Linux distributions is on the way and 
full support will be added soon. Thank you for patience and reporting any 
problems and wishes.
To run Sondovač you need UNIX-based operating system (preferably Linux or Mac 
OS X) equipped with BASH or compatible shell interpreter (this should be by 
default available for any Linux distribution, Mac OS X and any other UNIX-based 
operating system). You should use current operating system version supported by 
upstream. Otherwise we will not be able to help you in case of problems. Older 
operating systems can have different versions of shell and system libraries, 
which can cause various problems and incompatibilities.
Sondovač is using several scientific software packages (namely bam2fastq, BLAT, 
Bowtie2, CD-HIT, FASTX toolkit, FLASH, htsjdk, libgtextutils, Picard and 
SAMtools), and basic UNIX tools. Sondovač will check if those programs are 
installed - available in the PATH (i.e. if the shell application can locate and 
launch respective binaries). If you have those packages installed (in current 
versions), ensure their binaries are in PATH. This should not be problem for 
basic tools available in any UNIX-based operating system as basic installation 
usually contain all needed tools. If you are missing some of required tools, the 
script will notify you and you will have to install them manually. If this will 
be needed, check documentation for your operating system.
If required scientific programs are not installed, Sondovač will offer you 
installation. You can use precompiled binaries available together with the 
script or (sometimes) from the web. This is the recommended way. In case you 
would like to compile required software yourselves, the script will guide you 
through this process. Anyway, it is recommended only for advanced users as 
compilation might be sometimes very tricky. This is currently fully implemented 
only for Linux distributions Ubuntu and openSUSE. Support for another Linux 
distributions and Mac OS X will be added soon. For compilation you need Apache 
Ant, GNU G++, GNU GCC, GIT, Java, libpng developmental files and zlib 
developmental files. Ensure you have those tools available - they should be 
readily available for any UNIX-based operating system.

First launch of Sondovač

Download latest version of Sondovač from https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/ and 
unpack the archive. You can run Sondovač from any directory. In command line 
navigate to directory with unpacked Sondovač files (i.e. cd /path/to/sondovac) 
and start it by
./sondovac_part_a.sh -h
to see basic usage instructions. See README for more information. If you are not 
familiar with usage of command line, see some basic tutorial first. You can try

Vocabulary
* binary - An application in form understandable by the computer, but usually 
not transferable among operating systems and/or hardware platforms.
* BASH - "The command line" - full featured programming scripting language 
accessible through terminal of any UNIX-based operating system.
* compilation - "Translation" of software application from source code (text 
readable by human programmer) into binary form launchable by computer. It 
requires special tools and it usually must be done for every operating system 
and hardware platform.
* GNU - Major project providing free software widely used in many operating 
systems, see https://gnu.org/
* library - Pack of software tools and functions used by another applications.
* Linux - One of the most common variants of UNIX-based operating systems. Linux 
kernel is used by many developers, so that there are plenty of Linux 
distributions ("flavors") from various sources (e.g. Ubuntu and derivatives, 
openSUSE, SLE, Debian, Linux Mint, Fedora, Centos, RedHat etc). They share many 
features although on the first look they can look differently.
* Mac OS X - Popular operating system produced by Apple. The system kernel is 
based on UNIX, see https://www.apple.com/osx/
* openSUSE - Popular Linux distribution, see https://www.opensuse.org/
* operating system - Basic system running on your computer - typically MS 
Windows (not supported by Sondovač, although it might be working), Mac OS X or 
some Linux distribution (Ubuntu and derivatives, openSUSE, SLE, Debian, Linux 
Mint, Fedora, Centos, RedHat etc).
* PATH - Directories in the computer where system is looking for installed 
software (in UNIX-based system you can view it by command "echo $PATH"). If you 
need to modify it manually, see documentation for your operating system.
* script - Software application. It requires an interpret (application installed 
on the computer able to launch scripts written in particular language), but the 
application itself is portable among operating systems and hardware 
architectures and it is written in plain text, so that developers can easily 
modify it.
* shell - "The command line" - the interface to interact with software using 
commands typed into terminal window.
* Ubuntu - Popular Linux distribution, see http://www.ubuntu.com/
* upstream - Developers usually support (e.g. by fixing of bugs) only newer 
versions of an application. If you use older version and you encounter problem, 
no one will probably help you. Moreover, using old versions of software can be 
security risky because of security issues fixed in newer versions.
* UNIX (UNIX-like, UN*X, *nix, ...) - Family of operating systems sharing same 
logic, software architecture and plenty of tools. See 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like for details.
