Sondovač 0.8 Install instructions

Requirements to run Sondovač
================================================================================

Sondovač is currently tested on the Linux distributions Ubuntu and openSUSE. 
Testing on Mac OS X and other major Linux distributions is on the way and 
full support will be added soon. Thank you for patience and reporting any 
problems and wishes.

In order to run Sondovač you need a UNIX-based operating system (preferably 
Linux or Mac OS X) equipped with BASH or compatible shell interpreter (this 
should be by default available for any Linux distribution, Mac OS X and any 
other UNIX-based operating system like Solaris, BSD and its variants etc). You 
should use the current operating system version supported by upstream. 
Otherwise we will not be able to help you in case of problems. Older operating 
systems can have different versions of shell and system libraries, which can 
cause various problems and incompatibilities.

Sondovač is using several scientific software packages (namely bam2fastq, BLAT, 
Bowtie2, CD-HIT, FASTX toolkit, FLASH, Geneious, htsjdk, libgtextutils, Picard 
and SAMtools - see required versions and links below), and basic UNIX tools. 
Sondovač will check if those programs are installed - available in the PATH 
(i.e. if the shell application can locate and launch respective binaries). If 
you have those packages installed (in current versions), ensure their binaries 
are in PATH. This should not be a problem for basic tools available in any 
UNIX-based operating system, as basic installation usually contains all needed 
tools. If you are lacking some of the required tools, the script will notify 
you, and you will have to install them manually. If this will be needed, check 
the documentation for your operating system.

If required scientific programs are not installed, Sondovač will offer you 
installation. You can use precompiled binaries available together with the 
script or (sometimes) from the web. This is the recommended way. In case you 
would like to compile required software yourselves, the script will guide you 
through this process. Anyway, it is recommended only for advanced users, as 
compilation might sometimes be very tricky. It is currently fully implemented 
only for the Linux distributions Ubuntu and openSUSE. Support for other Linux 
distributions and Mac OS X will be added soon. For compilation you need Apache 
Ant, GNU G++, GNU GCC, GIT, Java, libpng developmental files and zlib 
developmental files. Ensure you have those tools available - they should be 
readily available for any UNIX-based operating system.

sondovac_part_a.sh requires (and will install) following software packages:
* BLAT
* Bowtie2
* SAMtools
* bam2fastq (will be replaced by Picard in future release)
* FLASH
* FASTX-toolkit

sondovac_part_b.sh requires (and will install) following software packages:
* CD-HIT
* BLAT

Geneious is required for step of the pipeline. See below and README for details.

Following UNIX tools are required to run Sondovač. They are usually readily 
available in Mac OS X, any Linux distribution or another UNIX system, so there 
is usually no need to install them manually. The tools are awk, bc, bunzip2, 
cat, cp, curl, cut, dirname, echo, egrep, cd, g++, gcc, grep, gunzip, join, 
less, lsb_release, make, mkdir, perl, pkg-config, pwd, sed, sort, tar, tr, 
uname, uniq, unzip, wc. See also details in PDF manual.


First launch of Sondovač
================================================================================

Download the latest version of Sondovač from 

https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/releases/

and unpack the archive. You can run Sondovač from any directory. In command 
line navigate to the directory with the unpacked Sondovač files:

  cd /path/to/directory_with_sondovac

and start it by

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -h

to see basic usage instructions. See README for more information.

Examples (see README for explanation of command line parameters)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic and the most simple usage (running in interactive mode, see README):

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -i

Specify some of required input files, otherwise run interactively:

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -f input.fa -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Running in non-interactive automated way (parameter "-n", see README) with 
example data downloaded from https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/wiki/Sample-data:

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -f input1_JHCN_Oxalis_corniculata_transcriptome_data.fa \
  -c input2_Ricinus_communis_reference_plastid_genome.fsa -m \
  input5_Ricinus_communis_reference_mitochondrial_genome.fasta -t \
  input3_J12_Oxalis_obtusa_genome_skim_data_R1.fastq -q \
  input4_J12_Oxalis_obtusa_genome_skim_data_R2.fastq -n

Modify parameter "-a", otherwise run interactively:

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -a 300

Run in non-interactive mode (parameter "-n", see README) - i such case user 
must specify all required input files (parameters "-f", "-c", "-m", "-t" and 
"-q"). Moreover, parameter "-y" is modified:

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fasta -m referencemt.fsa \
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq -y 90

Modifying parameter "-s". Note interactive mode "-i" is implicit and does not 
need to be specified explicitly:

  ./sondovac_part_a.sh -s 950


Help for usage of terminal
================================================================================

If you are not familiar with the usage of command line, see some basic tutorial 
first. You can try some of those:

* https://activedoc.opensuse.org/book/opensuse-start-up/chapter-17-shell-basics
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
* https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/ (advanced - full reference manual)

* https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/22/html/System_Administrators_Guide


Geneious
================================================================================

Sondovač workflow is divided into three parts (see README for details):
1) Raw input data are analyzed by sondovac_part_a.sh.
2) Obtained sequences are assembled by Geneious manually by user.
3) Final probes are produced by sondovac_part_b.sh.

For the part (2) user must have Geneious. We plan to replace it by some free 
open-source command line tool in some future release of Sondovač. Visit 
http://www.geneious.com/ for download, purchase, installation and usage of 
Geneious. It is very feature-rich application.

Vocabulary
================================================================================

* Binary - An application in form understandable by the computer, but usually 
  not transferable among operating systems and/or hardware platforms. Binaries 
  in Windows usually have extension *.exe, in UNIX there use to be no extension.
* BASH - "The command line" - fully featured programming scripting language 
  accessible through terminal of any UNIX-based operating system (any Linux, 
  Mac OS X, Solaris, any variant of BSD and more). BASH scripts usually have 
  extension *.sh.
* BSD - Group of popular UNIX-based operating systems. See 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution
* Compilation - "Translation" of software application from the source code 
  (text readable by human programmer) into binary form launchable by the 
  computer. It requires special tools, and it usually must be done for every 
  operating system and hardware platform.
* Console - see "shell".
* GNU - Major project providing free software widely used in many operating 
  systems, see https://gnu.org/
* Library - Pack of software tools and functions used by another applications.
* Linux - One of the most common variants of UNIX-based operating systems. 
  Linux kernel is used by many developers, so that there are plenty of Linux 
  distributions ("flavors") from various sources (e.g. Ubuntu and derivatives, 
  openSUSE, SLE, Debian, Linux Mint, Fedora, Centos, RedHat etc.). They share 
  many features although on the first look they can look differently. See
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux
* Mac OS X - Popular operating system produced by Apple. The system kernel is 
  based on UNIX, see https://www.apple.com/osx/
* openSUSE - Popular Linux distribution, see https://www.opensuse.org/
* Operating system - Basic system running on your computer - typically MS 
  Windows (not supported by Sondovač, although it might be working), Mac OS X or 
  some Linux distribution (Ubuntu and derivatives, openSUSE, SLE, Debian, Linux 
  Mint, Fedora, Centos, RedHat etc.).
* Parameter(s) - Option(s) passed to any function/command line application to 
  modify its usage. Some can be required, some are optional and some can be 
  used only in particular cases. In case of shell applications, parameters are 
  usually given in way like "application -X", "application --parameter", 
  "application -Param SomeValue" and so on. See manual for particular 
  application (e.g. "man application"), in case of Sondovač see README.
* PATH - Directories in the computer where the system is looking for installed 
  software (in a UNIX-based system you can view it by the command "echo $PATH"). 
  If you need to modify it manually, see the documentation for your operating 
  system.
* Script - Software application. It requires an interpreter (application 
  installed on the computer that is able to launch scripts written in a 
  particular language), but the application itself is portable among operating 
  systems and hardware architectures, and it is written in plain text, so that 
  developers can easily modify it. Common examples are Python, Perl or BASH.
* Shell - "The command line" - the interface to interact with software using 
  commands typed into the terminal window.
* Solaris - Popular (mainly on servers) UNIX-based operating system, now 
  developed by Oracle and including several independent clones. See
  http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=solaris
* Terminal - see "shell".
* Ubuntu - Popular Linux distribution, see http://www.ubuntu.com/
* Upstream - Developers usually support (e.g. by fixing of bugs) only newer 
  versions of an application. If you use an older version and you encounter 
  problems, no one will probably help you. Moreover, using old versions of 
  software can be a security risk because of security issues fixed in newer 
  versions.
* UNIX (UNIX-like, UN*X, *nix, ...) - Family of operating systems sharing the 
  same logic, software architecture and plenty of tools. See 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like for details.
