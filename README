Sondovač 0.99 RC Basic help

Sondovač (English pronunciation is "Sondovach") is a script to create 
orthologous low-copy nuclear probes from transcriptome and genome skim data for 
target enrichment.


Script summary
================================================================================

Phylogenetics benefits from using a large number of putatively independent 
nuclear loci and the combination with other sources of information, such as the 
plastid and mitochondrial genome. Selecting such orthologous low-copy nuclear 
(LCN) loci is still a challenge for non-model organisms. In recently published 
phylogenies based on target enrichment of several hundred LCN genes, these loci 
were selected from transcriptomes, genomes, gene expression studies, the 
literature, or a combination of these sources. Automated bioinformatic 
pipelines for the selection of LCN genes are, however, largely absent. We 
created a user-friendly, automated and interactive script named Sondovač to 
design LCN loci by a comparison between transcriptome and genome skim data. 
The script is licensed under open-source license GPL v.3 allowing further 
modifications. It runs on major Linux distributions and Mac OS X. Strong 
bioinformatics skills and access to high-performance computer clusters are not 
required; Sondovač runs on a standard desktop computer equipped with modern CPU 
like Intel i5 or i7.


Pipeline - how the data are processed
================================================================================

A transcriptome assembly and paired-end genome skim raw data are combined to 
get hundreds of orthologous LCN loci. Enrichment of multi-copy loci is 
minimized by using unique transcripts only, which are obtained by comparing all 
transcripts and removing those sharing ≥90% sequence similarity using BLAT. 
Before matching the genome skim data against those unique transcripts, reads of 
plastid (and mitochondrial) origin are removed with Bowtie 2, SAMtools and 
bam2fastq utilizing reference sequences. Paired-end reads are subsequently 
combined with FLASH. These processed reads are matched against the unique 
transcripts sharing ≥85% sequence similarity with BLAT. Transcripts with >1000 
BLAT hits, indicating repetitive elements, and BLAT hits containing masked 
nucleotides are removed before de novo assembly of the BLAT hits to larger 
contigs with Geneious, using the medium sensitivity / fast setting. After 
assembly, only those contigs that comprise exons of a minimum bait length 
(usually ≥120 bp in case of probe design for phylogenies) and have a certain 
minimum total locus length (multiple of the bait length, should not be too 
short in order to obtain sufficient phylogenetically informative signal; we 
recommend at least ≥600 bp) are retained. To ensure that probes do not target 
multiple similar loci, any probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity are 
removed using cd-hit-est, followed by a second filtering step for contigs 
containing exons of a minimum bait length and totaling minimum loci length (see 
comments above). To ensure that plastid sequences are absent from the probes, 
the probe sequences are matched against the plastome reference sharing ≥90% 
sequence similarity with BLAT and the hits removed from the probe set. The 
workflow of Sondovač is summarized in Figure 1 of the PDF manual.

For comprehension improvement the steps of Sondovač are consecutively numbered.

Sondovač has three parts: two script parts and an intermediate part using 
Geneious. The workflow is as follows:

A) sondovac_part_a.sh: Covers steps 1 to 6.
  1)   Removal of transcripts sharing ≥90% sequence similarity.
  2)   Removal of reads of plastid origin.
  3)   Removal of reads of mitochondrial origin (optional).
  4)   Combination of paired-end reads.
  5)   Matching of the unique transcripts and the filtered, combined genome 
       skim reads sharing ≥85% sequence similarity.
  6)   Filtering of BLAT output:
  6.1) Choice of transcript or genome skim sequences for further processing.
  6.2) Removal of transcripts with >1000 BLAT hits.
  6.3) Removal of transcript or genome skim BLAT hits [depending on the 
       selection in (6.1)] containing masked nucleotides.

Input files for sondovac_part_a.sh are FASTA transcriptome data, FASTQ 
paired-end genome skim reads and a plastome (and possibly also mitochondriome) reference. The input file for Geneious is the output of 
sondovac_part_a.sh.

B) Geneious: Covers step 7 (see below and PDF manual)
  7)  De novo assembly of the transcript or genome skim BLAT hits [depending 
      on the selection in (6.1)] to larger contigs. Note that you need a copy of 
      Geneious for this step.

The output files of Geneious are input files for sondovac_part_b.sh.

C) sondovac_part_b.sh: Covers steps 8 to 11.
  8)  Retention of those contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have a 
      certain total locus length.
  9)  Removal of probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity.
  10) Retention of those contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have a 
      certain total locus length.
  11) Removal of probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity with the 
      plastome reference.

The output file of sondovac_part_b.sh is the final list of probes.


Software dependencies and installation
================================================================================

Requirements to run Sondovač
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sondovač is using several scientific software packages (namely bam2fastq, BLAT, 
Bowtie2, CD-HIT, FASTX toolkit, FLASH, Geneious, htsjdk, libgtextutils, Picard, 
and SAMtools - see required versions and links below), and basic UNIX tools (see below). 
Sondovač will check if those programs are installed - available in the PATH 
(i.e. if the shell application can locate and launch respective binaries). If 
you have those packages installed (in current versions), ensure that their binaries 
are in PATH. This should not be a problem for basic tools available in any 
UNIX-based operating system, as basic installation usually contains all needed 
tools. If you lack some of the required tools, the script will notify 
you, and you will have to install them manually. If this will be needed, check 
the documentation for your operating system.

If required scientific programs are not installed, Sondovač will offer you 
installation. You can use precompiled binaries available together with the 
script (this is the recommended option) or (sometimes) from the web. This is 
the recommended way. In case you would like to compile required software 
yourself, the script will guide you through this process. Anyway, this is 
recommended only for advanced users, as compilation might sometimes be very 
tricky. Users of Mac OS X can install those applications also using Homebrew 
(see http://brew.sh/). For compilation you need Apache Ant, GNU G++, GNU GCC, 
GIT, Java/OpenJDK, libpng developmental files, and zlib developmental files. 
Ensure you have those tools available - they should be readily available for 
any UNIX-based operating system.

The following UNIX tools are required to run Sondovač. They are usually readily 
available in UNIX systems (but see note for Mac OS X below), so there is 
usually no need to install them manually. The tools are awk, bc, bunzip2, cat, 
cp, curl or wget, cut, dirname, echo, egrep, cd, g++, gcc, grep, gunzip, join, less, 
lsb_release or python (for Linux), make, mkdir, perl, pkg-config, pwd, sed, sort, tar, tr, uname, 
uniq, unzip, wc.

sondovac_part_a.sh requires (and will install) the following software packages:
* BLAT
* Bowtie2
* SAMtools
* bam2fastq (will be replaced by Picard in a future release)
* FLASH
* FASTX-toolkit

sondovac_part_b.sh requires (and will install) the following software packages:
* CD-HIT
* BLAT

For Mac OS X users, Homebrew (see http://brew.sh/ and https://github.com/Homebrew/) will be installed by the script, and it will 
install (new software or newer versions) Apache Ant, BASH (the shell interpreter), GNU AWK, GNU 
coreutils, GNU GCC, git, GNU grep, GNU make, pkg-config, GNU sed, and wget. Mac 
OS X is missing some tools and for others (typically sed, grep or awk) contains 
too old BSD versions. The script will guide the user through the process, and if 
user would wish, it is possible to safely and easily remove these tools afterwards.

See the PDF manual for details about tools required by Sondovač and their manual 
installation. For most users it should be sufficient to be guided by the script 
to install needed tools automatically.

When Sondovač starts, a directory "bin" is created in the current working directory. In there 
Sondovač saves binaries of required software packages (if they are not 
available). The user can then add this directory to PATH, move or delete it 
afterwards. See the PDF manual for details.

Geneious
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geneious is a DNA alignment, assembly, and analysis software and one of the 
most common software platforms used in genomics. It is utilized for de novo 
assembly in Sondovač. We plan to replace it by some free open-source command 
line tool in some future release of Sondovač. Visit http://www.geneious.com/ 
for download, purchase, installation and usage of Geneious. After the input data 
are processed (interactively or not) by sondovac_part_a.sh, the user must 
process its output manually by Geneious according to the instructions given below. The output 
of Geneious is then processed by sondovac_part_b.sh, which produces the final probe 
set. Geneious was tested with versions 6, 7 and 8.

Import the output file of part A of the script (sondovac_part_a.sh): go to menu 
File | Import | From File... This file is named as:
*_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data-no_missing_fin.fsa

Select the file and go to menu Tools | Align / Assemble | De Novo Assemble.
In "Data" frame select "Assemble by 1st (...) Underscore".
In "Method" frame select Geneious Assembler (if you don't have other 
assemblers, this option might be missing) and "Medium Sensitivity / Fast" 
Sensitivity.

In "Results" frame check "Save assembly report", "Save list of unused reads", 
"Save in sub-folder", "Save contigs" (do not check "Maximum") and "Save 
consensus sequences". Do not trim. Otherwise keep defaults. Run it.
Geneious may warn about possible hanging because of big file size. Do not use 
Geneious for other tasks during the assembly. Running Geneious may take a long time.

Select all resulting contigs (typically named "* Contig #") and export them 
(go to menu File | Export | Selected Documents...) as "Tab-separated table 
values (*.tsv)". Save the following columns (Hold Ctrl key to mark more fields): 
"# Sequences", "% Pairwise Identity", "Description", "Mean Coverage", "Name" 
and "Sequence Length". If this option would be inaccessible for you, export 
all columns.

Warning! Do not select and export "* Consensus Sequences", "* Unused Reads" or 
"* Assembly Report" - only the individual "* contig #" files.

Select items "Consensus Sequences" and "Unused Reads" and export them as one 
FASTA. Go to menu File | Export | Selected Documents... and choose FASTA file 
type.

Use the exported files from Geneious as input for part B of the script 
(sondovac_part_b.sh).

-e       Display detailed citation information and exit. See the PDF manual for 
           more information.
-o       Set name of output files. Output files will start with that name. Do 
           not use spaces or special characters - some software can not handle 
           them correctly. Default value (if the user does not provide another 
           name) is "output". See below for the list of produced output files.
-i       Running in interactive mode - the script will on-demand ask for the required 
           input files, installation of missing software etc.. This is the 
           recommended default value (the script runs interactively without 
           explicitely using option "-n").
-n       Running in non-interactive mode. The user must provide at least the required 
           input files (see below). You can use only one of parameters "-i" or 
           "-n" (not both of them). If script fails to find some of required 
           software packages, it will exit. This is recommended for batch or 
           repeated analysis, on remote servers and for more advanced users. 
           The user must be sure that all required software is installed (see 
           INSTALL and PDF manual for details).

Input files:
  Those parameters are required when running in non-interactive mode.
  The parameters are optional in default interactive mode.
  Please, use file names without spaces and without special characters.

-f FILE  Transcriptome input file in FASTA format.
         sondovac_part_a.sh
-c FILE  Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
         sondovac_part_a.sh, sondovac_part_b.sh
         Plastome reference sequences from taxa up to the same order of the 
           studied plant group are suitable. See Shannon C K. Straub, Matthew 
           Parks, Kevin Weitemier, Mark Fishbein, Richard C. Cronn and Aaron 
           Liston; American Journal of Botany (2012) 99(2): 349-364, 
           http://www.amjbot.org/content/99/2/349.short
-m FILE  Mitochondriome reference sequence input file in FASTA format (optional)
         sondovac_part_a.sh
         This step is facultative, as plant mitochondrial genomes have largely 
           variable sizes and high rearrangement rates.
-t FILE  Paired-end genome skim input file in FASTQ format (first file).
         sondovac_part_a.sh
-q FILE  Paired-end genome skim input file in FASTQ format (second file).

         sondovac_part_b.sh

Optional parameters:
  See chapter "Pipeline" for steps referred here.
  If those parameters are not provided, the default values are used, and it is not
    possible to change them any time later (not even in interactive mode).

-a ###   Maximum overlap length expected in approximately ≥90% of read pairs (parameter -M of FLASH, 
           see its manual for details).
         Step 4 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         FLASH can not combine paired-end reads that do not overlap by at least 10 bp (default minimum overlap length).
         DEFAULT: 65
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 10 to 300
-y ##    Sequence similarity between unique transcripts and the filtered, 
           combined genome skim reads (parameter -minIdentity of BLAT, see its 
           manual for details).
         Step 5 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         Filtering for orthologs, using sequence similarity as criterion.
         DEFAULT: 85 (highly recommended)
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 70 to 100
-g ####  Choice of transcript or genome skim sequences for further processing.
         Step 6.1 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         Depending on the phylogenetic depth that should be obtained, the probe sequences need to be designed from either the transcript or genome skim sequences, or it might not matter (if the taxa, from which the transcriptome and genome skim data were generated, are closely related).
         DEFAULT: no usage of -g (genome skim sequences)
         OPTIONS: usage of -g (transcript sequences)
-s ####  Number of BLAT hits per transcript when matching unique transcripts 
           and the filtered, combined genome skim reads.
	 Step 6.2 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         Transcripts with a high number of BLAT hits, indicating repetitive 
           elements, need to be removed from the putative probe sequences.
         DEFAULT: 1000
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 100 to 10000
-b ###   Minimum exon (bait) length.
         Steps 8 and 10 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         The minimum exon length should not fall below the bait length in order 
           to account for specific binding between genomic libraries and baits 
           during hybridization.
         DEFAULT: 120 (optimal length for phylogeny).
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 120 to 200
-k ###   Minimum total locus length.
         Steps 8 and 10 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         When running the script in interactive mode, the user will be asked which value to use. A table summarizing the total number of LCN loci, which will be the result of the probe design for all minimum total locus lengths that the user can select (600 bp, 720 bp, 840 bp, 960 bp, 1080 bp, 1200 bp), will be displayed to facilitate this choice.
         DEFAULT: 600
         OPTIONS: 720, 840, 960, 1080, 1200
-d 0.##  Sequence similarity between probe sequences (parameter -c of cd-hit-est, see its manual for details).
         Step 9 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         Probes that target multiple similar loci need to be removed.
         DEFAULT: 0.9 (highly recommended).
         OPTIONS: Decimal ranging from 0.85 to 0.95
-y ##    Sequence similarity between probe sequences and plastome reference (parameter -minIdentity of BLAT, see its 
           manual for details).
         Step 11 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         Some plastid reads might not have been removed in step2; they should be removed in this step.
         DEFAULT: 90 (highly recommended)
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 70 to 100

Examples:

The basic and most simple usage (running in interactive mode):
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i

Specify some of the required input files, otherwise run interactively:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -f input.fa -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Running in non-interactive, automated way:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fa -m referencemt.fa \
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Modify parameter "-a", otherwise run interactively:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -a 300

Run in non-interactive mode (parameter "-n") - in such case the user must specify 
   all required input files (parameters "-f", "-c", "-m", "-t" and "-q"). 
   Moreover, parameter "-y" is modified:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fa -m referencemt.fa 
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq -y 90

Modifying parameter "-s". Note that the interactive mode -i is implicit and does not 
  need to be specified explicitly:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -s 950


Input and output files
================================================================================

All names of input files and paths to them must be without spaces and without 
special characters (some software have difficulties to handle them).

Script sondovac_part_a.sh requires as input files:
1) Transcriptome input file in FASTA format. Note: For technical reasons, the labels 
   of FASTA sequences must be unique numbers (no other characters). 
   Sondovač will check the labels, and if they are not in an appropriate form, a copy 
   of this input file with correct labels will be created.
2) Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
3) Paired-end genome skim input file in FASTQ format (two files - forward and 
   reverse reads).
4) OPTIONAL: Mitochondriome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
   This file is not required.

Script sondovac_part_a.sh creates the following files:
0)  *_renamed.fasta - If needed, copy of the transcriptome input file with the changed 
      labels of the FASTA sequences (unique numbers corresponding to the line numbers in the  
      original file) will be created. File *_old_and_new_names.tsv then 
      contains two columns: 1) the original sequence labels as in the user-provided 
      transcriptome input file and 2) new sequence labels. This might be useful 
      to trace back certain sequences/probes.
1)  *_blat_unique_transcripts.psl - Output of BLAT (removal of transcripts 
      sharing ≥90% sequence similarity).
2)  *_unique_transcripts.fasta - Unique transcripts in FASTA format.
3)  *_genome_skim_data_no_cp_reads.bam - SAM converted to BAM (removal of reads 
      of plastid origin).
4)  *_genome_skim_data_no_cp_reads* - Genome skim data without cpDNA reads.
5)  *_genome_skim_data_no_cp_no_mt_reads.bam - SAM converted to BAM (removal of 
      reads of mitochondrial origin) - only if mitochondriome reference 
      sequence was used.
6)  *_genome_skim_data_no_cp_no_mt_reads* - Genome skim data without mtDNA 
      reads - only if mitochondriome reference sequence was used.
7)  *_combined_reads_co_cp_no_mt_reads* - Combined paired-end genome skim reads.
8)  *_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data.pslx - Output of BLAT 
      (matching of the unique transcripts and the filtered, combined genome 
      skim reads sharing ≥85% sequence similarity).
9)  *_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data.fasta - Matching 
      sequences in FASTA.
10) *_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data-no_missing_fin.fsa - 
      Final FASTA sequences for usage in Geneious.
Files 1-9 are not necessary for further processing by this pipeline, but may be 
useful for the user. The last file (10) is used as input file for Geneious in 
the next step. An asterisk (*) denotes the beginning of the output files' names 
specified by the user with parameter "-o". If the user does not select a custom name, 
default value ("output") will be used.

Geneious requires as input the last output file of sondovac_part_a.sh (file 10: 
*_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data-no_missing_fin.fsa).

Output of Geneious are two exported files (see Geneious chapter):
1) Final assembled sequences exported as TSV.
2) Final assembled sequences exported as FASTA.

Script sondovac_part_b.sh requires as input files:
1) Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
2) Assembled sequences exported from Geneious as TSV.
3) Assembled sequences exported from Geneious as FASTA.

Script sondovac_part_b.sh creates the following files:
1) *_prelim_probe_seq.fasta - Preliminary probe sequences.
2) *_similarity_test.fasta - Contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have 
     a certain total locus length.
3) *_target_enrichment_probe_sequences.fasta - Probes in FASTA.
4) *_possible_cp_dna_genes_in_probe_set.pslx - In case of any BLAT hits, the user might needs to manually remove these probe sequences from *_target_enrichment_probe_sequences.fasta (the previous script outfile) - these are then the final probe sequences in FASTA.

An asterisk (*) denotes the beginning of the output files' names specified by the user 
with parameter "-o". If user does not select a custom name, default value 
("output") will be used.

By default, output files are created in the same directory from which Sondovač was 
launched. Output files can be saved in a custom directory by specifying an output 
directory together with parameter "-o":

# Find current directory (e.g. /home/user):
pwd
# Launching Sondovač located in directory /home/user/sondovac and save output 
# to e.g. desktop (/home/user/Desktop):
./sondovac/sondovac_part_a.sh -o Desktop/MyFile
# Sondovač will save software (if needed) in "bin" directory located in 
# directory from which it was launched, see it:
ls bin/*
# Output files are in desired directory, see them e.g. by:
ls -lh Desktop/MyFile*


Sample data
================================================================================

Together with the script, we provide the ZIP archive (1.8 GB) that contains 
exemplary input files for running the script: Oxalis genome skim data as well 
as the Ricinus cpDNA and mtDNA reference sequences. See 
https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/wiki/Sample-data for download of sample data.

The package contains:

1) input2_Ricinus_communis_reference_plastid_genome.fsa - cpDNA reference 
   (parameter -c), GenBank reference number NC_016736.
2) input3_J12_Oxalis_obtusa_J12_genome_skim_data_R1.fastq - paired-end genome 
   skim data, file 1 (parameter -t).
3) input4_J12_Oxalis_obtusa_J12_genome_skim_data_R2.fastq - paired-end genome 
   skim data, file 2 (parameter -q).
4) input5_Ricinus_communis_reference_mitochondrial_genome.fasta - mtDNA 
   reference (parameter -m), GenBank reference number NC_015141.

The transcriptome input file is unpublished data from G. K.-S. Wong et al.. As soon as the data will be published, we will 
post them on GitHub. Data can now be found under

Record output of Sondovač
================================================================================

To record the whole output of Sondovač (regardless used parameters), use 
utility "tee". This will produce a plain text output with everything printed to the 
screen. It can be useful for reference or explorations is something went wrong. 
Use it as follows:

./sondovac_part_a.sh | tee records.log
