Sondovač 0.6 Basic help

Sondovač is a script to create orthologous low-copy nuclear probes from 
transcriptome and genome skim data for target enrichment.


Script summary
================================================================================

Phylogenetics benefits from using a large number of putatively independent 
nuclear loci and their combination with other sources of information, such as 
the plastid and mitochondrial genomes. Currently, target enrichment (sequence 
capture) of hundreds of loci in combination with genome skimming is becoming 
increasingly popular in phylogenetics. In animal phylogenomics non-exonic or 
partly exonic ultraconserved elements and their quite variable flanking regions 
are often utilized. For plant phylogenetics, low-copy nuclear (LCN) genes are 
targeted due to the paucity of ultraconserved nuclear sequences. Due to 
sequence divergence, target sequencing strategies for plant nuclear genomes are 
largely lineage-specific, requiring the de novo design of target enrichment 
probes. We developed a novel probe design pipeline for targeting orthologous 
LCN loci for phylogenetic reconstruction by using genome skim and transcriptome 
data. We implemented our software workflow in the user-friendly, automated and 
interactive BASH script Sondovač.


Pipeline - how the data are processed
================================================================================

A transcriptome assembly and paired-end genome skim raw data are combined to 
get hundreds of orthologous LCN loci. Enrichment of multi-copy loci is 
minimized by using unique transcripts only, which are obtained by comparing all 
transcripts and removing those sharing ≥90% sequence similarity using BLAT. 
Before matching the genome skim data against those unique transcripts, reads of 
plastid (and mitochondrial) origin are removed with Bowtie 2, SAMtools and 
bam2fastq utilizing reference sequences. Paired-end reads are subsequently 
combined with FLASH. These processed reads are matched against the unique 
transcripts sharing ≥85% sequence similarity with BLAT. Transcripts with >1000 
BLAT hits, indicating repetitive elements, and BLAT hits containing masked 
nucleotides are removed before de novo assembly of the BLAT hits to larger 
contigs with Geneious, using the medium sensitivity / fast setting. After 
assembly, only those contigs that comprise exons of a minimum bait length 
(usually ≥120 bp in case of probe design for phylogenies) and have a certain 
minimum total locus length (multiple of the bait length, should not be too 
short in order to obtain sufficient phylogenetically informative signal; we 
recommend at least ≥600 bp) are retained. To ensure that probes do not target 
multiple similar loci, any probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity are 
removed using cd-hit-est, followed by a second filtering step for contigs 
containing exons of a minimum bait length and totaling minimum loci length (see 
comments above). To ensure that plastid sequences are absent from the probes, 
the probe sequences are matched against the plastome reference sharing ≥90% 
sequence similarity with BLAT and the hits removed from the probe set. The 
workflow of Sondovač is summarized in the Figure 1 in PDF manual.

For comprehension improvement the steps of Sondovač are consecutively numbered.

Sondovač has three parts: two script parts and an intermediate part using 
Geneious. The workflow is as follows:

A) sondovac_part_a.sh: Covers steps 1 to 6
  1)   Removal of transcripts sharing ≥90% sequence similarity 
  2)   Removal of reads of plastid origin
  3)   Removal of reads of mitochondrial origin (optional)
  4)   Combination of paired-end reads
  5)   Matching of the unique transcripts and the filtered, combined genome 
       skim reads sharing ≥85% sequence similarity
  6)   Filtering of BLAT output:
  6.1) Choice of transcript or genome skim sequences for further processing
  6.2) Removal of transcripts with >1000 BLAT hits
  6.3) Removal of transcript or genome skim BLAT hits [depending on the 
       selection in (6.1)] containing masked nucleotides

Input files for sondovac_part_a.sh are FASTA transcriptome data, FASTQ 
paired-end genome skim reads and a plastome (and possible as well 
mitochondriome) reference. The input file for Geneious is the output of 
sondovac_part_a.sh

B) Geneious: Covers step 7 (see below and PDF manual)
  7)  De novo assembly of the transcript or genome skim BLAT hits [depending 
      on the selection in (6.1)] to larger contigs. Note you need a copy of 
      Geneious for this step.

The output files of Geneious are input files for sondovac_part_b.sh.

C) sondovac_part_b.sh: Covers steps 8 to 11
  8)  Retention of those contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have a 
      certain total locus length
  9)  Removal of probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity
  10) Retention of those contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have a 
      certain total locus length
  11) Removal of probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity with the 
      plastome reference

The output file of sondovac_part_b.sh is the final list of probes.


Software dependencies and installation
================================================================================

Requirements to run Sondovač
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sondovač is using several scientific software packages (namely bam2fastq, BLAT, 
Bowtie2, CD-HIT, FASTX toolkit, FLASH, htsjdk, libgtextutils, Picard and 
SAMtools - see required versions and links below), and basic UNIX tools. 
Sondovač will check if those programs are installed - available in the PATH 
(i.e. if the shell application can locate and launch respective binaries). If 
you have those packages installed (in current versions), ensure their binaries 
are in PATH. This should not be a problem for basic tools available in any 
UNIX-based operating system, as basic installation usually contains all needed 
tools. If you are lacking some of the required tools, the script will notify 
you, and you will have to install them manually. If this will be needed, check 
the documentation for your operating system.

If required scientific programs are not installed, Sondovač will offer you 
installation. You can use precompiled binaries available together with the 
script or (sometimes) from the web. This is the recommended way. In case you 
would like to compile required software yourselves, the script will guide you 
through this process. Anyway, it is recommended only for advanced users, as 
compilation might sometimes be very tricky. It is currently fully implemented 
only for the Linux distributions Ubuntu and openSUSE. Support for other Linux 
distributions and Mac OS X will be added soon. For compilation you need Apache 
Ant, GNU G++, GNU GCC, GIT, Java, libpng developmental files and zlib 
developmental files. Ensure you have those tools available - they should be 
readily available for any UNIX-based operating system.

Geneious
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geneious is a DNA alignment, assembly, and analysis software and one of the 
most common software platforms used in genomics. It is utilized for de novo 
assembly in Sondovač. We plan to replace it by some free open-source command 
line tool in some future release of Sondovač. Visit http://www.geneious.com/ 
for download, purchase, installation and usage of Geneious.

Geneious was tested with versions 6, 7 and 8.

Import output file of part A of the script (sondovac_part_a.sh): go to menu 
File | Import | From File... This file is named as:
YourInputFile_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data-no_missing_fin.fsa

Select the file and go to menu Tools | Align / Assemble | De Novo Assemble.
In "Data" frame select "Assembe by 1st (...) Underscore".
In "Method" frame select Geneious Assembler (if you don't have other 
assemblers, this option might be missing) and "Medium Sensitivity / Fast" 
Sensitivity.

In "Results" frame check "Save assembly report", "Save list of unused reads", 
"Save in sub-folder", "Save contigs" (do not check "Maximum") and "Save 
consensus sequences". Do not trim. Otherwise keep defaults. Run it.
Geneious may warn about possible hanging because of big file. Do not use 
Geneious for other tasks during the assembly. Running may take long time.

Select all resulting contigs (typically named "* Contig #") and export them 
(go to menu File | Export | Selected Documents...) as "Tab-separated table 
values (*.tsv)". Save following columns (Hold Ctrl key to mark more fields): 
"# Sequences", "% Pairwise Identity", "Description", "Mean Coverage", "Name" 
and "Sequence Length". If this option would be inaccessible for you, export 
all columns.

Select items "Consensus Sequences" and "Unused Reads" and export them as one 
FASTA. Go to menu File | Export | Selected Documents... and choose FASTA file 
type.

Use exported files from Geneious as input for part B of the script 
(sondovac_part_b.sh).

         default value (the script runs interactively without explicit using 
         option "-n").
-n       Running in non-interactive mode. User must provide at least required 
         input files (see below). You can use only one of parameters "-i" or 
         "-n" (not both of them). If script fails to find some of required 
         software packages, it will exit. This is recommended for batch or 
         repeated analysis, on remote servers and for more advanced users. User 
         must be sure that all required software is installed (see INSTALL and
         PDF manual for details).

  The parameters are optional in default interactive mode.
  Please, use file names without spaces and without special characters.

-f FILE  Transcriptome input file in FASTA format.
         sondovac_part_a.sh
-c FILE  Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
         sondovac_part_a.sh, sondovac_part_b.sh
         Plastome reference sequences from taxa up to the same order of the 
           studied plant group are suitable. See Shannon C K. Straub, Matthew 
           Parks, Kevin Weitemier, Mark Fishbein, Richard C. Cronn and Aaron 
           Liston; American Journal of Botany (2012) 99(2): 349-364, 
           http://www.amjbot.org/content/99/2/349.short
-m FILE  Mitochondriome reference sequence input file in FASTA format 
(optional).
         sondovac_part_a.sh
         This step is facultative, as plant mitochondrial genomes have largely 
           variable sizes and high rearrangement rates.

-z FILE  Input file in FASTA format (output of Geneious assembly).
         sondovac_part_b.sh

Optional parameters:
  See chapter "Pipeline" for steps referred here.
  If those parameters are not provided, default values are used and it is not
    possible to change them any time later (not even in interactive mode).

-a ###   Read length of paired-end genome skim reads (parameter -M of FLASH, 
         see its manual for details).
         Step 4 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         Ensure to use a certain insert size of the genome skim genomic library 
         in combination with an appropriate read length for sequencing in order 
         to enable merging of the paired-end genome skim reads.
         DEFAULT: 250
         OPTIONS: 125, 150, 250, 300
-y ##    Sequence similiarity between unique transcripts and the filtered, 
         combined genome skim reads (parameter -minIdentity of BLAT, see its 
         manual for details).
         Step 5 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         Consider the trade-off between probe specificity and number of 
         remaining matching sequences for probe design. Sequence similarity is 
         in percent.
         DEFAULT: 85
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 70 to 100
-s ####  Number of BLAT hits per transcript when matching unique transcripts 
         and the filtered, combined genome skim reads.
	 Step 6.2 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         Transcripts with a high number of BLAT hits, indicating repetitive 
         elements, need to be removed from the putative probe sequences.
         DEFAULT: 1000
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 100 to 10000
-b ###   Minimum exon (bait) length.
         Steps 8 and 10 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         The minimum exon length should not fall below the bait length in order 
         to facilitate specific binding between genomic libraries and baits 
         during hybridization.
         DEFAULT: 120 (optimal length for phylogeny).
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 120 to 200
-d 0.##  Sequence similarity between probe sequences (parameter -c of 
         cd-hit-est, see its manual for details).
         Step 9 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         Too similar probe sequences will interact with each other during 
         hybridization and thereby reduce enrichment efficiency.
         DEFAULT: 0.9 (highly recommended).
         OPTIONS: Decimal ranging from 0.85 to 0.95

Examples:

Basic and the most simple usage:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i

Specify some of required input files, otherwise run interactively:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -f input.fa -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Running in non-interactive automated way:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fa -m referencemt.fa \
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Modify parameter "-a", otherwise run interactively:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -a 300

Run in non-interactive mode (parameter "-n") - in such case user must specify 
   all required input files (parameters "-f", "-c", "-m", "-t" and "-q"). 
   Moreover, parameter "-y" is modified:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fa -m referencemt.fa 
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq -y 90

Modifying parameter "-s". Note interactive mode -i is implicit and does not 
  need to be specified explicitly:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -s 950
