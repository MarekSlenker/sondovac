Script summary
================================================================================
A transcriptome assembly and paired-end genome skim raw data are combined to 
get hundreds of orthologous LCN loci. Enrichment of multi-copy loci is 
minimized by using unique transcripts only, which are obtained by comparing all 
transcripts and removing those sharing ≥90% sequence similarity using BLAT. 
Before matching the genome skim data against those unique transcripts, reads of 
plastid (and mitochondrial) origin are removed with Bowtie 2, SAMtools and bam2fastq utilizing reference 
sequences. Paired-end reads are subsequently combined with FLASH. These 
processed reads are matched against the unique transcripts sharing ≥85% 
sequence similarity with BLAT. Transcripts with >1000 BLAT hits, indicating 
repetitive elements, and BLAT hits containing masked nucleotides are removed 
before de novo assembly of the BLAT hits to larger contigs with Geneious, using 
the medium sensitivity / fast setting. After assembly, only those contigs that 
comprise exons of a minimum bait length (usually ≥120 bp in case of probe 
design for phylogenies) and have a certain minimum total locus length (multiple 
of the bait length, should not be too short in order to obtain sufficient 
phylogenetically informative signal; we recommend at least ≥600 bp) are 
retained. To ensure that probes do not target multiple similar loci, any probe 
sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity are removed using cd-hit-est, 
followed by a second filtering step for contigs containing exons of a minimum 
bait length and totaling minimum loci length (see comments above). To ensure 
that plastid sequences are absent from the probes, the probe sequences are 
matched against the plastome reference sharing ≥90% sequence similarity with 
BLAT and the hits removed from the probe set.


Software dependencies and installation
================================================================================
Requirements to run Sondovač
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sondovač is using several scientific software packages (namely bam2fastq, BLAT, 
Bowtie2, CD-HIT, FASTX toolkit, FLASH, htsjdk, libgtextutils, Picard and 
SAMtools), and basic UNIX tools. Sondovač will check if those programs are 
installed - available in the PATH (i.e. if the shell application can locate and 
launch respective binaries). If you have those packages installed (in current 
versions), ensure that their binaries are in PATH. This should not be a problem 
for basic tools available in any UNIX-based operating system, as basic 
installation usually contains all needed tools. If you are lacking some of the 
required tools, the script will notify you, and you will have to install them 
manually. If this will be needed, check the documentation for your operating 
system.
If required scientific programs are not installed, Sondovač will offer you 
installation. You can use precompiled binaries available together with the 
script or (sometimes) from the web. This is the recommended way. In case you 
would like to compile required software yourselve, the script will guide you 
through this process. Anyway, it is recommended only for advanced users, as 
compilation might sometimes be very tricky. It is currently fully implemented 
only for the Linux distributions Ubuntu and openSUSE. Support for other Linux 
distributions and Mac OS X will be added soon. For compilation you need Apache 
Ant, GNU G++, GNU GCC, GIT, Java, libpng developmental files and zlib 
developmental files. Ensure you have those tools available - they should be 
readily available for any UNIX-based operating system.

Geneious (See http://www.geneious.com/ for download and purchase.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geneious is a DNA alignment, assembly, and analysis software and one of the most common software platforms used in genomics. It is utilized for de novo assembly in Sondovač.

Check file INSTALL for further details.

Basic usage
================================================================================
The workflow of Sondovač is summarized in the figure. Each step of Sondovač is colorcoded: Software is highlighted in yellow, a summary of each step is given in blue, and input/output of each step is depicted in green. The direction of the workflow is indicated by arrows. Optional removal of reads of mitochondrial origin from the genome skim data is marked by decoloration. The required input files of Sondovač are highlighted in bold.
For comprehension improvement the steps of Sondovač are consecutively numbered.

Sondovač has three parts: two script parts and an intermediate part using Geneious. The workflow is as follows:
A) sondova_part_a.sh: Covers steps 1 to 6 (see figure)
   1)    Removal of transcripts sharing ≥90% sequence similarity 
   2)    Removal of reads of plastid origin
   3)    Removal of reads of mitochondrial origin (facultative)
   4)    Combination of paired-end reads
   5)    Matching of the unique transcripts and the filtered, combined genome skim reads sharing ≥85% sequence similarity
   6)    Filtering of BLAT output:
   6.1)  Choice of transcript or genome skim sequences for further processing
   6.2)  Removal of transcripts with >1000 BLAT hits
   6.3)  Removal of transcript or genome skim BLAT hits [depending on the selection in (6.1)] containing masked nucleotides
   Input files for sondova_part_a.sh are FASTA transcriptome data, FASTQ paired-end genome skim reads and a plastome (and mitochondriome) reference.
B) Geneious: Covers step 7 (see figure)
   7)    De novo assembly of the transcript or genome skim BLAT hits [depending on the selection in (6.1)] to larger contigs. Note. You need a copy of Geneious for this step. Visit http://www.geneious.com/ for details.
   The input file for Geneious is the output of sondova_part_a.sh.
C) sondova_part_b.sh: Covers steps 8 to 11 (see figure)
   8)    Retention of those contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have a certain total locus length
   9)    Removal of probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity
   10)   Retention of those contigs that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have a certain total locus length
   11)   Removal of probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity with the plastome reference
   The input file for sondova_part_b.sh is the Geneious output.

Geneious details (Step 7 of Sondovač)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geneious was tested with versions 6, 7 and 8.

Import output file of part A of the script (sondova_part_a.sh) (File | Import | From File...).

Select the file and go to menu Tools | Align / Assemble | De Novo Assemble.
In \"Data\" frame select \"Assembe by 1st (...) Underscore\".
In \"Method\" frame select Geneious Assembler (if you don't have other assemblers, this option might be missing) and \"Medium Sensitivity / Fast\" Sensitivity.
In \"Results\" frame check \"Save assembly report\", \"Save list of unused reads\", \"Save in sub-folder\", \"Save contigs\" (do not check \"Maximum\") and \"Save consensus sequences\". Do not trim. Otherwise keep defaults. Run it.
Geneious may warn about possible hanging because of big file. Do not use Geneious for other tasks during the assembly.

Select all resulting contigs (typically named \"* Contig #\") and export them (File | Export | Selected Documents...) as \"Tab-separated table values (*.tsv)\". Save following columns (Hold Ctrl key to mark more fields): \"# Sequences\", \"% Pairwise Identity\", \"Description\", \"Mean Coverage\", \"Name\" and \"Sequence Length\". If this option would be inaccessible for you, export all columns.

Select items \"Consensus Sequences\" and \"Unused Reads\" and export them as one FASTA. Go to menu File | Export | Selected Documents... and choose FASTA file type.

Use exported files from Geneious as input for part B of the script (sondova_part_b.sh).
