Script summary
================================================================================
A transcriptome assembly and paired-end genome skim raw data are combined to get 
hundreds of orthologous LCN loci. Enrichment of multi-copy loci is minimized by 
using unique transcripts only, which are obtained by comparing all transcripts 
and removing those sharing ≥90% sequence similarity using BLAT. Before matching 
the genome skim data against those unique transcripts, reads of plastid and 
mitochondrial origin are removed with Bowtie 2 utilizing reference sequences. 
Paired-end reads are subsequently combined with FLASH. These processed reads are 
matched against the unique transcripts sharing ≥85% sequence similarity with 
BLAT. Transcripts with >1000 BLAT hits, indicating repetitive elements, and BLAT 
hits containing masked nucleotides are removed before de novo assembly of the 
BLAT hits to larger contigs with Geneious, using the medium sensitivity / fast 
setting. After assembly, only those contigs that comprise exons of a minimum 
bait length (usually ≥120 bp in case of probe design for phylogenies) and have a 
certain minimum total locus length (multiple of the bait length, should not be 
too short in order to obtain sufficient phylogenetically informative signal; we 
recommend at least ≥600 bp) are retained. To ensure that probes do not target 
multiple similar loci, any probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity are 
removed using cd-hit-est, followed by a second filtering step for contigs 
containing exons of a minimum bait length and totaling minimum loci length (see 
comments above). To ensure that plastid sequences are absent from the probes, 
the probe sequences are matched against the plastome reference sharing ≥90% 
sequence similarity with BLAT and the hits removed from the probe set.


Installation
================================================================================
Check file INSTALL for details.


Basic usage
================================================================================
The script is splited into two parts. The work-flow is as follows:
1) sondova_part_a.sh: Analyzes FASTQ reads together with reference genome and
   removes plastid and mitochodroial genes.
2) Geneious: Note. You need copy of Geneious for this step. Visit 
   http://www.geneious.com/ for details. It is used to assembly the rads.
3) sondova_part_b.sh: It uses output of Geneious and produces final probes.
