Sondovač 1.2 Basic help

Sondovač is a script to create orthologous low-copy nuclear probes from 
transcriptome and genome skim data for target enrichment.


Script summary
================================================================================

Phylogenetics benefits from using a large number of putatively independent 
nuclear loci and their combination with other sources of information, such as 
the plastid and mitochondrial genome. Selecting such orthologous low-copy 
nuclear (LCN) loci is still a challenge for non-model organisms. In recently 
published phylogenies based on target enrichment of several hundred LCN genes, 
these loci were selected from transcriptomes, genomes, gene expression studies, 
the literature, or a combination of these sources. Automated bioinformatic 
pipelines for the selection of LCN genes are, however, largely absent. We 
created a user-friendly, automated and interactive script named Sondovač to 
design LCN loci by a comparison between transcriptome and genome skim data. 
The script is licensed under open-source license GPL v.3 allowing further 
modifications. It runs on major Linux distributions and Mac OS X. Strong 
bioinformatics skills and access to high-performance computer clusters are not 
required; Sondovač runs on a standard desktop computer equipped with modern CPU 
like Intel i5 or i7.


Pipeline - how the data are processed
================================================================================

A transcriptome assembly and paired-end genome skim raw data are combined to 
get hundreds of orthologous LCN loci. Enrichment of multi-copy loci is 
minimized by using unique transcripts only, which are obtained by comparing all 
transcripts and removing those sharing ≥90% sequence similarity using BLAT. 
Before matching the genome skim data against those unique transcripts, reads of 
plastid (and mitochondrial) origin are removed with Bowtie 2, SAMtools and 
bam2fastq utilizing reference sequences. Paired-end reads are subsequently 
combined with FLASH. These processed reads are matched against the unique 
transcripts sharing ≥85% sequence similarity with BLAT. Transcripts with >1000 
BLAT hits (indicating repetitive elements) and BLAT hits containing masked 
nucleotides are removed before de novo assembly of the BLAT hits to larger 
contigs with Geneious, using the medium sensitivity / fast setting. After 
assembly, only those contigs that comprise exons of a minimum bait length 
(usually ≥120 bp in case of probe design for phylogenies) and have a certain 
minimum total locus length (multiple of the bait length, should not be too 
short in order to obtain sufficient phylogenetically informative signal; we 
recommend at least ≥600 bp) are retained. To ensure that probes do not target 
multiple similar loci, any probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity are 
removed using cd-hit-est, followed by a second filtering step for contigs 
containing exons of a minimum bait length and totaling minimum loci length (see 
comments above). To ensure that plastid sequences are absent from the probes, 
the probe sequences are matched against the plastome reference sharing ≥90% 
sequence similarity with BLAT and the hits removed from the probe set. The 
workflow of Sondovač is summarized in Figure 1 of the PDF manual. Sondovač has 
three parts: two script parts and an intermediate part using Geneious. Input 
files for sondovac_part_a.sh are FASTA transcriptome data, FASTQ paired-end 
genome skim reads and a plastome (and possibly also mitochondriome) reference. 
The input file for Geneious is the output of sondovac_part_a.sh. The output 
files of Geneious are input files for sondovac_part_b.sh. The output file of 
sondovac_part_b.sh is the final list of probes, from which the user needs to 
remove the putative plastid sequences indicated in step 11 of the pipeline. In 
case of detection of remaining plastid sequences you will have to remove those 
plastid sequences manually from the output file of sondovac_ part_b.sh (see 
detailed documentation of sondovac_part_b.sh in the PDF manual).


Software dependencies and installation
================================================================================

Requirements to run Sondovač
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sondovač uses several scientific software packages and UNIX tools. See INSTALL 
and PDF manual for details.

Geneious
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geneious is a DNA alignment, assembly, and analysis software and one of the 
most common software platforms used in genomics. It is utilized for de novo 
assembly in Sondovač. We plan to replace it by a free open-source command 
line tool in a future release of Sondovač. Visit https://www.geneious.com/ 
for download, purchase, installation and usage of Geneious. After the input 
data are processed (interactively or not) by sondovac_part_a.sh, the user must 
process its output manually by Geneious according to the instructions given 
in the PDF manual. The output of Geneious is then processed by sondovac_part_b
.sh, which produces the final probe set. Geneious was tested with versions 6, 
7, 8 and 9. See PDF manual for details.


Command-line parameters to run Sondovač
================================================================================

General parameters:
  Shared by sondovac_part_a.sh as well as sondovac_part_b.sh.

           https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/releases/, download of the newer 
           version will be offered to the user.
-l       Display LICENSE for license information (this script is licensed under 
           GNU GPL v.3, other software under variable licenses). Exit viewing 
           by pressing the "Q" key.
-r       Display README (this file) for detailed usage instructions. Exit 
           viewing by pressing the "Q" key. More information is available in 
           the  PDF manual.
-p       Display INSTALL for detailed installation instructions. Exit viewing 
           by pressing the "Q" key. More information is available in the PDF 
           manual.
-e       Display detailed citation information and exit. See the PDF manual for 
           more information.
-o       Set name of output files. Output files will start with that name. Do 
           not use spaces or special characters - some software can not handle 
           them correctly. Default value (if the user does not provide another 
           name) is "output". See below for the list of produced output files.
-i       Running in interactive mode - the script will on-demand ask for the 
           required input files, installation of missing software etc. This is 
           he recommended default value (the script runs interactively without 
           explicitly using option "-n").
-n       Running in non-interactive mode. The user must provide at least the 
           required input files (see below). You can use only one of parameters 
           "-i" or "-n" (not both of them). If script fails to find some of the
           required software packages, it will exit. This is recommended for 
           batch or repeated analysis, on remote servers and for more advanced 
           users. The user must be sure that all required software is installed 
           (see INSTALL and PDF manual for details).

Input files:
  Those parameters are required when running in non-interactive mode.
  The parameters are optional in default interactive mode.

Optional parameters:
  See chapter "Pipeline" for steps referred here.
  If those parameters are not provided, the default values are used, and it is 
  not possible to change them at a later point (not even in interactive mode).

-a ###   Maximum overlap length expected in approximately ≥90% of read pairs 
           (parameter -M of FLASH, see its manual for details). FLASH can not 
           combine paired-end reads that do not overlap by at least 10 bp 
           (default minimum overlap length).
         Step 4 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         DEFAULT: 65
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 10 to 300
-y ##    Sequence similarity between unique transcripts and the filtered, 
           combined genome skim reads (parameter -minIdentity of BLAT, see its 
           manual for details). Filtering for orthologs, using sequence 
           similarity as criterion.
         Step 5 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         DEFAULT: 85 (highly recommended)
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 70 to 100
-g       Choice of transcript or genome skim sequences for further processing. 
           Depending on the phylogenetic depth that should be obtained, the 
           probe sequences need to be designed from either the transcript or 
           genome skim sequences, or it might not matter (if the taxa, from 
           which the transcriptome and genome skim data were generated, are 
           closely related).
         Step 6.1 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         DEFAULT: no usage of -g (genome skim sequences)
         OPTIONS: usage of -g (transcript sequences)
-s ####  Number of BLAT hits per transcript when matching unique transcripts 
           and the filtered, combined genome skim reads. Transcripts with a 
           high number of BLAT hits, indicating repetitive elements, need to 
           be removed from the putative probe sequences.
         Step 6.2 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_a.sh.
         DEFAULT: 1000
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 100 to 10000
-b ###   Minimum exon (bait) length. The minimum exon length should not fall 
           below the bait length in order to account for specific binding 
           between genomic libraries and baits during hybridization.
         Steps 8 and 10 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         DEFAULT: 120 (preferred length for phylogeny).
         OPTIONS: 80, 100, 120
-k ###   Minimum total locus length. When running the script in interactive 
           mode, the user will be asked which value to use. A table summarizing 
           the total number of LCN loci, which will be the result of the probe 
           design for all minimum total locus lengths that the user can select 
           (600 bp, 720 bp, 840 bp, 960 bp, 1080 bp, 1200 bp), will be 
           displayed to facilitate this choice.
         Steps 8 and 10 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         DEFAULT: 600
         OPTIONS: 600, 720, 840, 960, 1080, 1200
-d 0.##  Sequence similarity between probe sequences (parameter -c of 
           cd-hit-est, see its manual for details). Probes that target multiple 
           similar loci need to be removed.
         Step 9 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         DEFAULT: 0.9 (highly recommended).
         OPTIONS: Decimal ranging from 0.85 to 0.95
-y ##    Sequence similarity between probe sequences and plastome reference 
           (parameter -minIdentity of BLAT, see its manual for details). Some 
           plastid reads might not have been removed in step2; they should be 
           removed by this step.
         Step 11 of Sondovač, sondovac_part_b.sh.
         DEFAULT: 90 (highly recommended)
         OPTIONS: Integer ranging from 70 to 100


Examples:

The basic and most simple usage (running in interactive mode):
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i

Specify some of the required input files, otherwise run interactively:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -f input.fa -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Running in non-interactive, automated mode:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fa -m referencemt.fa \
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq

Modify parameter "-a", otherwise run interactively:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -i -a 300

Run in non-interactive mode (parameter "-n") - in such case the user must 
  specify all required input files (parameters "-f", "-c", "-m", "-t" and 
  "-q"). Moreover, parameter "-y" is modified:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -n -f input.fa -c referencecp.fa -m referencemt.fa \
  -t reads1.fastq -q reads2.fastq -y 90

Modifying parameter "-s". Note that the interactive mode -i is implicit and 
  does not need to be specified explicitly:
./sondovac_part_a.sh -s 950


Input and output files
================================================================================

All names of input files and paths to them must be without spaces and without 
special characters (some software have difficulties handling these).

Script sondovac_part_a.sh requires as input files:
1) Transcriptome input file in FASTA format. Note: For technical reasons, the 
   labels of FASTA sequences must be unique numbers (no other characters). 
   Sondovač will check the labels, and if they are not in an appropriate form, 
   a copy of this input file with correct labels will be created.
2) Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
3) Paired-end genome skim input file in FASTQ format (two files - forward and 
   reverse reads).
4) OPTIONAL: Mitochondriome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
   This file is not required.

Script sondovac_part_a.sh creates the following files:
1)  *_renamed.fasta - If needed, copy of the transcriptome input file with the 
      changed labels of the FASTA sequences (unique numbers corresponding to 
      the line numbers in the  original file) will be created. File 
2)  *_old_and_new_names.tsv then contains two columns: 1) the original 
      sequence labels as in the user-provided transcriptome input file and 2) 
      new sequence labels. This might be useful to trace back certain 
      sequences/probes. 1)  *_blat_unique_transcripts.psl - Output of BLAT 
      (removal of transcripts sharing ≥90% sequence similarity).
3)  *_unique_transcripts.fasta - Unique transcripts in FASTA format.
4)  *_genome_skim_data_no_cp_reads* - Genome skim data without cpDNA reads.
5)  *_genome_skim_data_no_cp_no_mt_reads* - Genome skim data without mtDNA 
      reads - only if mitochondriome reference sequence was used.
6)  *_combined_reads_co_cp_no_mt_reads* - Combined paired-end genome skim reads.
7)  *_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data.pslx - Output of BLAT 
      (matching of the unique transcripts and the filtered, combined genome 
      skim reads sharing ≥85% sequence similarity).
8)  *_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data.fasta - Matching 
      sequences in FASTA.
9) *_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data-no_missing_fin.fsa - 
      Final FASTA sequences for usage in Geneious.
Files 1-8 are not necessary for further processing by this pipeline, but may be 
useful for the user. The last file (9) is used as input file for Geneious in 
the next step.

Geneious requires as input the last output file of sondovac_part_a.sh (file 9: 
*_blat_unique_transcripts_versus_genome_skim_data-no_missing_fin.fsa).

Output of Geneious are two exported files (see Geneious chapter in the PDF 
manual):
1) Final assembled sequences exported as TSV.
2) Final assembled sequences exported as FASTA.

Script sondovac_part_b.sh requires as input files:
1) Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
2) Assembled sequences exported from Geneious as TSV.
3) Assembled sequences exported from Geneious as FASTA.

Script sondovac_part_b.sh creates the following files:
1) *_prelim_probe_seq.fasta - Preliminary probe sequences.
2) *_prelim_probe_seq_cluster_100.fasta - Unclustered exons and clustered exons 
     with 100% sequence identity.
3) *_prelim_probe_seq_cluster_90.clstr - Unclustered exons and clustered exons 
     with more than a certain sequence similarity (CLSTR file).
4) *_unique_prelim_probe_seq.fasta - Unclustered exons / exons with less than a 
     certain sequence similarity.
5) *_similarity_test.fasta - Exons that comprise exons ≥ bait length and have 
     a certain total locus length.
6) *_target_enrichment_probe_sequences.fasta - Probes in FASTA.
7) *_possible_cp_dna_genes_in_probe_set.pslx - In case of any BLAT hits, the 
     user might need to manually remove these plastid probe sequences from 
     *_target_enrichment_probe_sequences.fasta (the previous script outfile); 
     the remaining ones are the final probe sequences in FASTA.

An asterisk (*) denotes the beginning of the output files' names specified by 
the user with parameter "-o". If user does not select a custom name, default 
value ("output") will be used.

By default, output files are created in the same directory from which Sondovač 
was launched. Output files can be saved in a custom directory by specifying an 
output directory together with parameter "-o":

# Find current directory (e.g. /home/user):
pwd
# Launching Sondovač located in directory /home/user/sondovac and save output 
# to e.g. desktop (/home/user/Desktop):
./sondovac/sondovac_part_a.sh -o Desktop/MyFile
# Sondovač will save software (if needed) in "bin" directory located in 
# directory from which it was launched, see it:
ls bin/*
# Output files are in desired directory, see them e.g. by:
ls -lh Desktop/MyFile*


Sample data
================================================================================

Together with the script, we provide the ZIP archive (~1.8 GB) containing 
example input files for running the script: Oxalis genome skimming data and 
transcriptome as well as the Ricinus cpDNA and mtDNA reference sequences. See 
https://github.com/V-Z/sondovac/wiki/Sample-data for download of sample data.


Record output of Sondovač
================================================================================

To record the whole output of Sondovač (regardless of used parameters), use 
utility "tee". This will produce a plain text output with everything printed to 
the screen. It can be useful for reference or exploration if something went 
wrong. Use it as follows:

./sondovac_part_a.sh | tee records.log

You can use any command line arguments, script will behave as usual. The 
plain text file "records.log" will then contain all its output.
