Script summary
A transcriptome assembly and genome skim raw data are combined to get hundreds of orthologous LCN loci. Enrichment of multi-copy loci is minimized by using unique transcripts only, which are obtained by comparing all transcripts and removing those sharing ≥90% sequence similarity using BLAT v.32x1 (Kent, 2002). Before matching the genome skim data against those unique transcripts, reads of plastid and mitochondrial origin are removed with Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) utilizing reference sequences. Paired-end reads are subsequently combined with FLASH (Magoč and Salzberg, 2011). These processed reads are matched against the unique transcripts sharing ≥85% sequence similarity with BLAT. Transcripts with >1000 BLAT hits, indicating repetitive elements, and BLAT hits containing masked nucleotides are removed before de novo assembly of the BLAT hits to larger contigs with Geneious v.6.1.7 (Kearse et al., 2012), using the medium sensitivity / fast setting. After assembly, only those contigs that comprise exons of a minimum bait length (usually ≥120 bp) and have a certain minimum total locus length (multiple of the bait length, should not be too short in order to obtain sufficient phylogenetically informative signal; we recommend ≥600 bp) are retained. To ensure that probes do not target multiple similar loci, any probe sequences sharing ≥90% sequence similarity are removed using cd-hit-est v.4.5.4 (Li and Godzik, 2006), followed by a second filtering step for contigs containing exons of a minimum bait length and totaling minimum loci length (see comments above). To ensure that plastid sequences are absent from the probes, the probe sequences are matched against the plastome reference sharing ≥90% sequence similarity with BLAT and the hits removed from the probe set.
